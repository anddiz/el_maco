Docker Ubuntu - Quick setup guides for Ansible, Netmiko and Paramiko
Discussion · General Networking
Hey guys,

After following along with David Bombal's great Python series so I wanted to create a quick method to install
Netmiko and Paramiko which are great Python network libraries for SSH and Telnet network access to many vendor 
network OS's including Cisco IOS, Juniper JunOS and Arista EOS and many more.

 

Please see below quick and dirty guide for installing these below on the Ubuntu Docker container template in
the Appliances in the Marketplace.

 

Of course you will need to have Internet access and easy way to do this is configure a NAT router or NAT cloud
in GNS3 Version 2 RC and then configure the Ubuntu eth0 interface for DHCP.

This is easily done under config or in the Ubuntu OS CLI using command "nano /etc/network/interfaces" and
uncomment (IE remove) the # at the start of the lines as below.

# DHCP config for eth0
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

 

Hope this helps someone out to get going quickly.

 

Install Netmiko/Paramiko

apt-get update

apt-get install python -y

apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev -y

apt-get install python-pip -y

 

pip install cryptography

pip install paramiko

 

Or to install Netmiko

pip install netmiko

 

Install Ansible

apt-get update

apt-get install software-properties-common

apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible

press "enter" to confirm the addition of repository

apt-get update

apt-get install ansible

The only addition I would make, is to mention how to grab Ansible roles off galaxy. 

One of these days, I need to sit down and read the Docker books I have, so I could premake Ansible, Puppet, Chef, 
and Saltstack containers (including an ftp/scp server, so nodes can locally grab the client agents) Al Reid · 2 years ago
That my friend would be an awesome download.

 

I'm very new to Ansible but just wanted to show people how to get started without the barrier of setup which can
be a little overwhelming for those not ver familiar with Linux and packages and even the basic of PIP.

 

No expert like I said but thought it might be worth sharing.
